**Bone Fracture Detection using XAI techniques**

Link to dataset: https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mura/

The aim of this project is to determine whether the X-ray image has bone fracture or not. The dataset contains fractured and normal patient X-ray images. Firstly, deep learning models are implemented on the data and after that XAI techniques are applied to demonstrate the transparency of the model prediction.
